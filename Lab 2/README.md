# Complexity Analysis
Two algorithms with different complexity that count the number of triples in a
file of N integers that sums to 0.

* ThreeSumA.java
* ThreeSumB.java
* In.class
* Text files with different amount of integers.
* Performance graph for visualizing the vastly different performance.
* Complexity Analysis practical sheet.

#### First compile both files

```
javac ThreeSumA.java
```

```
javac ThreeSumB.java
```

#### Then run them, entering the integer file after

```
java ThreeSumA 1Kints.txt
```

#### Expected result after running

```
70
the time taken 338
```

#### And run the second algorithm

```
java ThreeSumB 1Kints.txt
```

#### Expected result after running

```
count =70
the time taken 95
```
